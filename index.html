    <h2><i>what is CSS?</i></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTMLelements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li><del>Car is not necessary</del><mark><b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b></mark>it can control the label of multiple webpages all at a time</li>
        <li><ins><i>External style sheets are stored in CSS files.</i></ins></li>
    </ol>
    <h2><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTMLelements.</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <mark><b> this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles ,</b></mark> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yorself</li>
    </ul>
    <p>when comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand ,applies a style to one unique element . ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element or range of elements and its used by JavaScript</p>
    <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on web page.Once an element is targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the  most commomnly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
